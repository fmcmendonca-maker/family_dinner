🍽️ Our Family Dinner App
🗓️ 1. Weekly Dinner Planning

Each week, we plan our dinners together.

Everyone gets to see the suggestions and vote for what they want to eat.

The most popular meals become our menu for the week.

❤️ 2. Voting Made Fun

We’ll all vote right from our iPhones.

You can rate meals with stars or emojis (👍👎❤️).

After everyone votes, the app shows which dinners won.

New ideas can always be added to try something different!

👩‍🍳 3. Who’s Cooking

Each night has a “chef of the day.”

We can rotate or pick who cooks.

Everyone knows in advance when it’s their turn.

The app sends a friendly reminder: “You’re the chef tonight!”

🍔 4. Dinner Out or Skip Night

Going out? Having leftovers?

Just mark the day as “Dinner Out” or “Skip.”

The app adjusts the shopping list automatically.

🛒 5. Shopping List

Once we pick our dinners, the app creates the shopping list.

It removes ingredients we already have in the kitchen.

We can check off items as we shop.

💡 6. Wishlist

Anyone can add new meal ideas (“Let’s try sushi night!”).

The family votes to decide which new dishes to try next.

📊 7. Weekly Summary

At the end of the week, we’ll see fun stats:

⭐ Best-rated meal of the week

🌟 The Goal

Make dinner planning simple, fair, and fun — everyone gets a say, nobody gets surprised, and the shopping takes care of itself.
